# My Website

Welcome to my website project! This project includes a responsive web design tailored for both desktop and mobile screens. Below, you'll find details on the design process, implementation, and future plans.

## Project Overview

### Design
- **Figma**: Used Figma to create two distinct designs for desktop and mobile screen sizes.
- **Challenges**: Tried using AI tools to export Figma designs directly to code, but the generated code was too complex and difficult to read.

### Development
- **HTML and CSS**: Handcrafted the HTML and CSS files to implement the designs.
- **GitHub Pages**: Deployed the website on GitHub Pages for hosting.

## Future Work

### Responsiveness
- **Objective**: Make the design fully responsive across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Approach**: Utilize media queries and flexible layout techniques to ensure a seamless user experience on all devices.

### Framework
- **Objective**: Learn and implement a popular front-end framework.
- **Options**: Consider frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
- **Goal**: Rewrite the codebase using the chosen framework to enhance maintainability and scalability.

## Lessons Learned
- **AI Tools**: While AI tools can assist in design-to-code workflows, manual adjustments are often necessary to achieve clean and efficient code.
- **Web Development**: Gained foundational knowledge in HTML, CSS, and responsive design principles within a week.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have a modern web browser installed.
